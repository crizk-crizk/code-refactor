# code-refactor

In this project, I improved the accessibility standards for the website. 
1. I replaced all the non-semantic html elements in the body for semantic ones. 
2. I made sure the structure is proper and organized. 
3. I added alt attributes to all images in the site. 
4. I made sure the heading attributes are in order. 
5. I change the website's title from "Website" to the company's name, Horiseon. 
6. I made all respective changes to the CSS to maintain the same appearance of the site.
